One-Time-Login Logout
---------------------
Forcibly log out any user who loads a one-time-login path who happens to be
logged in at the time and then show them the password reset form.

There are no settings for this module, it just silently works when it is
enabled.

Note: this should not have any security consequences as all it does is log out
the current user, which the person could do anyway.
